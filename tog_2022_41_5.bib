abstract = {This study presents a new method for modeling the interaction between compressible flow, shock waves, and deformable structures, emphasizing destructive dynamics. Extending advances in time-splitting compressible flow and the Material Point Methods (MPM), we develop a hybrid Eulerian and Lagrangian/Eulerian scheme for monolithic flow-structure interactions. We adopt the second-order WENO scheme to advance the continuity equation. To stably resolve deforming boundaries with sub-cell particles, we propose a blending treatment of reflective and passable boundary conditions inspired by the theory of porous media. The strongly coupled velocity-pressure system is discretized with a new mixed-order finite element formulation employing B-spline shape functions. Shock wave propagation, temperature/density-induced buoyancy effects, and topology changes in solids are unitedly captured.},

abstract = {In the field of topology optimization, the homogenization approach has been revived as an important alternative to the established, density-based methods. Homogenization can represent microstructures at length scales decoupled from the resolution of the computational grid. The optimal microstructure for a single load case is an orthogonal rank-3 laminate.Initially, we investigate where singularities occur in orthogonal rank-3 laminates and show that the laminar parts of the structures we seek are unaffected by the singularities. Based on this observation, we propose a method for generating multi-laminar structures from frame fields that describe rank-3 laminates. Rather than establishing a parametrization of the domain, we compute stream surfaces that align with the frame fields and solve an optimization problem to find a well-spaced collection of such stream surfaces. Since our method does not rely on a parametrization, we also do not need a combing of the frame fields to generate this collection. Finally, we provide a method for synthesizing multi-laminar structures from a stream surface collection. This method produces a volumetric solid for each surface and combines these to form the output.We demonstrate our method on several frame fields produced by the homogenization approach to topology optimization.},

abstract = {Neural rendering algorithms introduce a fundamentally new approach for photorealistic rendering, typically by learning a neural representation of illumination on large numbers of ground truth images. When training for a given variable scene, such as changing objects, materials, lights, and viewpoint, the space  ( mathcal {D} ) &nbsp;of possible training data instances quickly becomes unmanageable as the dimensions of variable parameters increase. We introduce a novel Active Exploration method using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, which explores  ( mathcal {D} ) , generating samples (i.e., ground truth renderings) that best help training and interleaves training and on-the-fly sample data generation. We introduce a self-tuning sample reuse strategy to minimize the expensive step of rendering training samples. We apply our approach on a neural generator that learns to render novel scene instances given an explicit parameterization of the scene configuration. Our results show that Active Exploration trains our network much more efficiently than uniformly sampling and, together with our resolution enhancement approach, achieves better quality than uniform sampling at convergence. Our method allows interactive rendering of hard light transport paths (e.g., complex caustics), which require very high samples counts to be captured, and provides dynamic scene navigation and manipulation, after training for 5 to 18 hours&nbsp;depending on required quality and variations.},

abstract = {We present a method to automatically synthesize efficient, high-quality demosaicking algorithms, across a range of computational budgets, given a loss function and training data. It performs a multi-objective, discrete-continuous optimization which simultaneously solves for the program structure and parameters that best tradeoff computational cost and image quality. We design the method to exploit domain-specific structure for search efficiency. We apply it to several tasks, including demosaicking both Bayer and Fuji X-Trans color filter patterns, as well as joint demosaicking and super-resolution. In a few days on 8 GPUs, it produces a family of algorithms that significantly improves image quality relative to the prior state-of-the-art across a range of computational budgets from 10 s to 1000&nbsp;s of operations per pixel (1 dB–3 dB higher quality at the same cost, or 8.5–200\texttimes{} higher throughput at same or better quality). The resulting programs combine features of both classical and deep learning-based demosaicking algorithms into more efficient hybrid combinations, which are bandwidth-efficient and vectorizable by construction. Finally, our method automatically schedules and compiles all generated programs into optimized SIMD code for modern processors.},

Our approach unrolls the computation into a massive expression graph, performs redundant expression elimination, grouping, and then generates an architecture-specific kernel to solve the same problem, assuming that the sparsity pattern is fixed, which is a common scenario in many applications in computer graphics and scientific computing. We show that our approach scales to large problems and can achieve speedups of two orders of magnitude on CPUs and three orders of magnitude on GPUs, compared to a set of manually optimized CPU baselines. To demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach, we employ it to optimize popular algorithms with applications to physical simulation and interactive mesh deformation.},

abstract = {We propose a physics-based combustion simulation method for computer graphics that extends the mathematical models of previous efforts to automatically capture more realistic flames as well as temperature and soot distributions. Our method includes mathematical models for the thermodynamic properties of real-world fuels which enables, for example, the prediction of adiabatic flame temperatures. We couple this with a model of heat transfer that includes convection, conduction as well as both radiative cooling and heating. This facilitates among other things ignition at a distance without heating up the intermediate air. We model the combustion as infinitely fast chemistry and couple this with the thin flame model, spatially varying laminar burning velocities based on local species and empirical measurements, physically validated soot formation and oxidation as well as water vapor production and condensation. We implement this on adaptive octree-like grids with collocated state variables, a new SBDF2-derived semi-Lagrangian time integrator for velocity, and a multigrid scheme used for multiple solver components. In combination, these models enable us to simulate deflagration phenomena ranging from small scale premixed and diffusion flames to fireballs and subsonic explosions which we demonstrate by several examples. In addition, we validate several of the results based on reference footage and measurements and discuss the relation of prevalent heuristic techniques arising in visual effects production to some of the physics-based models we propose.},

abstract = {Large-scale topological changes play a key role in capturing the fine debris of fracturing virtual brittle material. Real-world, tough brittle fractures have dynamic branching behaviour but numerical simulation of this phenomena is notoriously challenging. In order to robustly capture these visual characteristics, we simulate brittle fracture by combining elastodynamic continuum mechanical models with rigid-body methods: A continuum damage mechanics (CDM) problem is solved, following rigid-body impact, to simulate crack propagation by tracking a damage field. We combine the result of this elastostatic continuum model with a novel technique to approximate cracks as a non-manifold mid-surface, which enables accurate and robust modelling of material fragment volumes to compliment fast-and-rigid shatter effects. For enhanced realism, we add fracture detail, incorporating particle damage-time to inform localised perturbation of the crack surface with artistic control. We evaluate our method with numerous examples and comparisons, showing that it produces a breadth of brittle material fracture effects and with low simulation resolution to require much less time compared to fully elastodynamic simulations.},
